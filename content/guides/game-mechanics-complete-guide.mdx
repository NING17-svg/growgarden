- **Rich Soil**: Higher quality than basic soil, suitable for common vegetables and flowers. It can be purchased from the Garden Shop.
- **Premium Soil**: Best for rare flowers and exotic plants. It's more expensive but yields higher quality and quantity.
- **Magical Soil**: Only obtainable during special events, this soil is essential for growing event-specific plants.

### Land Expansion Strategy

Starting with a 3x2 plot (6 total spaces), you can expand your garden by purchasing additional plots:

- **First Expansion**: Adds 6 more plots (3x4 total) - Cost: 1,000 Sheckles
- **Second Expansion**: Adds 8 more plots (4x5 total) - Cost: 5,000 Sheckles
- **Third Expansion**: Adds 10 more plots (5x6 total) - Cost: 15,000 Sheckles
- **Maximum Expansion**: Up to 8x8 (64 total plots) - Cost: 100,000+ Sheckles

**Expansion Priority**: Focus on expanding when you have consistent income from multi-harvest crops. More plots mean more simultaneous crops and higher mutation chances.

### Plot Management

Efficient plot management is crucial for maximizing profits:

1. **Dedicated Zones**: Assign specific areas for different crop types
2. **Rotation Strategy**: Alternate between single and multi-harvest crops
3. **Accessibility**: Keep frequently harvested crops near the center
4. **Weather Optimization**: Position crops strategically for weather events

## The Complete Planting Process

Understanding the planting mechanics helps you optimize timing and resource allocation.

### Seed Selection and Purchasing

The seed shop refreshes every 5 minutes with random inventory:

**Seed Rarities and Base Values**:
- **Common** (70% chance): Carrots (5 Sheckles), Strawberries (15 Sheckles)
- **Uncommon** (20% chance): Tomatoes (25 Sheckles), Blueberries (40 Sheckles)
- **Rare** (7% chance): Grapes (75 Sheckles), Mangoes (120 Sheckles)
- **Legendary** (2.5% chance): Dragon Fruit (300 Sheckles), Golden Apples (500 Sheckles)
- **Mythical** (0.5% chance): Rainbow Flowers (1,000 Sheckles), Crystal Berries (2,000 Sheckles)

**Shopping Strategy**:
1. Check the shop every 5 minutes
2. Prioritize rare seeds when you have sufficient funds
3. Stock up on multi-harvest seeds during good rotations
4. Always buy mythical seeds when they appear

### Planting Mechanics

**Basic Planting Steps**:
1. Equip seeds from your inventory
2. Click on an empty, tilled plot
3. Wait for the planting animation to complete
4. The crop will begin its growth cycle

**Advanced Planting Tips**:
- Plant in batches to synchronize harvest times
- Consider growth times when planning layouts
- Plant before favorable weather when possible
- Use the "Plant All" feature for efficiency (unlocked at level 10)

### Growth Cycles and Timing

Each crop has specific growth phases:

**Growth Stages**:
1. **Seedling** (0-25% growth): Just planted, vulnerable to weather
2. **Young Plant** (25-50% growth): Developing, can receive some mutations
3. **Mature Plant** (50-75% growth): Can receive most mutations
4. **Ready to Harvest** (100% growth): Fully grown, maximum mutation potential

**Growth Time Examples**:
- Carrots: 5 minutes (single harvest)
- Strawberries: 10 minutes (multi-harvest, 3-minute intervals)
- Tomatoes: 15 minutes (multi-harvest, 5-minute intervals)
- Grapes: 30 minutes (multi-harvest, 8-minute intervals)
- Dragon Fruit: 60 minutes (multi-harvest, 15-minute intervals)

## Daily Management and Care

Proper daily management significantly impacts your garden's productivity.

### Watering Systems

**Manual Watering**:
- Use Watering Can (10 uses, 50 Sheckles)
- Increases growth speed by 25%
- Best for targeted acceleration

**Automated Watering**:
- Basic Sprinkler: Covers 3x3 area, lasts 5 minutes
- Advanced Sprinkler: Covers 5x5 area, increases mutation chance
- Godly Sprinkler: Covers entire garden, greatly increases mutations

**Watering Strategy**:
1. Use manual watering for urgent harvests
2. Deploy sprinklers when garden is full
3. Time sprinkler use with favorable weather
4. Prioritize mutation-boosting sprinklers for valuable crops

### Fertilization and Enhancement

**Fertilizer Types**:
- **Growth Fertilizer**: Reduces growth time by 50% (100 Sheckles)
- **Mutation Fertilizer**: Increases mutation chance by 25% (200 Sheckles)
- **Harvest Fertilizer**: Increases yield by 1-2 extra crops (150 Sheckles)
- **Premium Fertilizer**: Combines all effects (500 Sheckles)

**Application Strategy**:
1. Use Growth Fertilizer on slow-growing valuable crops
2. Apply Mutation Fertilizer before weather events
3. Use Harvest Fertilizer on multi-harvest crops
4. Save Premium Fertilizer for mythical crops

### Pest and Disease Management

**Common Issues**:
- **Aphids**: Reduce growth speed by 50%, removed with Pesticide (25 Sheckles)
- **Fungal Infection**: Prevents mutations, cured with Fungicide (40 Sheckles)
- **Wilting**: Occurs without water, reversed with immediate watering
- **Frost Damage**: Happens during extreme cold, prevented with Greenhouse (1,000 Sheckles)

**Prevention Strategy**:
1. Regular inspection of crops
2. Immediate treatment of issues
3. Preventive measures during weather events
4. Investment in protective structures
